# ETL Mini Project with Spring Boot & SQLite

This repository contains a **mini ETL study project** developed with **Spring Boot**, **JPA**, **SQLite**, and **OpenCSV**. The goal was to practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and explore how to build a small pipeline that:

1. Reads data from a CSV file.
2. Transforms it (filtering, uppercase conversion, total calculation).
3. Loads the processed data into a SQLite database.
4. Exposes an endpoint to upload CSV files.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* **Java 21**
* **Spring Boot 3.x**
* **Spring Data JPA**
* **SQLite JDBC Driver**
* **OpenCSV** for file parsing
* **JUnit 5** & **Spring Boot Test** for testing
* **Mockito** for mocking
* **Lombok** for boilerplate reduction

---

## ðŸ“š What We Practiced & Learned

### 1. **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**

* Wrote tests **before** implementation.
* Used `MockMvc` to validate REST endpoints.
* Tested business rules:

    * CSV import structure.
    * Total calculation (`price * quantity`).
    * Filtering only active users.
    * Converting customer names to uppercase.

### 2. **Entity Mapping & Persistence**

* Created the `Order` entity mapped to the `orders` table.
* Used **Spring Data JPA** repositories to persist data.
* Configured **SQLite** as the persistence database.
* Learned about **transaction rollback in tests** (data inserted during tests is rolled back).

### 3. **ETL Concepts in Practice**

* **Extract:** Reading the CSV file with OpenCSV.
* **Transform:**

    * Converting customer names to uppercase.
    * Filtering only active customers.
    * Calculating the `total` field.
* **Load:** Saving the transformed data into the SQLite database.

### 4. **REST API Endpoint**

* Implemented a `/savefile` endpoint to accept file uploads via `POST`.
* Validated file content (empty file â†’ `400 Bad Request`).
* On success â†’ `201 Created` with persistence of valid records.

### 5. **Testing Strategies**

* Used `@SpringBootTest` with `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests.
* Tested edge cases:

    * Empty file upload.
    * Only active users saved.
    * Proper data transformation before persistence.

## âš¡ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/etl-mini-project.git
   cd etl-mini-project
   ```

2. Build & run tests:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean test
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. Send a CSV file:

   ```bash
   curl -F "file=@transactions.csv" http://localhost:8080/savefile
   ```

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

* How **TDD** drives development by shaping implementation from tests.
* Difference between **unit tests** and **integration tests** with Spring Boot.
* Understanding of how Spring Boot handles **transactions and rollback in tests**.
* Hands-on application of **ETL concepts** with simple but realistic transformations.
* Practical experience with **file uploads**, **validation**, and **error handling** in REST APIs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps / Improvements

* Add validation for CSV structure (columns, data types).
* Extend transformations (e.g., currency formatting, date parsing).
* Expose a `GET /orders` endpoint to retrieve persisted data.
* Containerize with Docker.
* Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.

ðŸ’¡ *This project started as a study exercise but ended up being a practical playground for TDD, Spring Boot, and ETL concepts applied together.*
